LinkedIn often lists jobs as "remote" that aren't truly remoteâ€”they may require travel or onsite presence. This code filters out these misleading job postings by using specific keywords to identify and eliminate them. The goal is to find genuinely remote job opportunities efficiently.

### How It Works:

1. **Profile Access**: Opens your LinkedIn profile (option 1). option 2 is to search existing profile.
2. **Navigation**: Clicks on the 'Jobs' tab.
3. **Job Listings**: Clicks 'More' to load additional job listings.
4. **Iteration**: Iterates over each job listing on the left panel.
5. **Keyword Filtering**: Examines each job description for a set of 'anti-keywords' such as 'Travel', 'On Site', 'Hybrid', etc.
6. **Action on Keywords**: If an anti-keyword is found, the code closes the job tab and clicks 'X' to ensure the job is not shown again.
7. **User Review**: If no keywords are detected, the program pauses to allow the user to review the job.
    - A message "Hit any key to resume" is displayed, allowing the user to decide whether to apply or not before resuming the filtering process.

### Important Notes:

- **Automatic Mouse Movement**: This code uses automatic mouse movement and targeting instead of an API.
- **Screen Resolution**: The screen resolution must be set correctly for the mouse movements to align with the intended targets.
- **Display Changes**: Any changes in how LinkedIn is displayed may break the code, requiring adjustments to the script.

### Anecdote:

Using this program, I filtered through 300 job listings labeled as "remote." Only 10 passed my filters, saving me an enormous amount of time.
